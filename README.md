# indieVelo to Garmin Connect editor/uploader

This repo contains a script `garmin.py` that will edit [FIT](https://developer.garmin.com/fit/overview/) files
to make them appear to come from a Garmin device (Edge 830, currently) and upload them to Garmin Connect
using the [`garth`](https://github.com/matin/garth/) library. The FIT editing
is done using Stages Cycling's [`fit_tool`](https://bitbucket.org/stagescycling/python_fit_tool/src/main/) library.

My primary use case for this is that [TrainingPeaks Virtual](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/virtual/) (previously 
[indieVelo](https://indievelo.com/)) does not support (AFAIK, Garmin does not allow) automatic uploading to
[Garmin Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/). The files can be manually uploaded after the fact,
but since they are not "from Garmin", they will not be used to calculate Garmin's "Training Effect",
which is used for suggested workouts and other stuff. By changing the FIT file to appear to come
from a Garmin device, those features will be should be enabled.

## Installation

Required Python 3.12. If your system python is older than that, I recommend
using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage locally installed versions.

It's probably best to create a new virtual environment:

```bash
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements:

```bash
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Usage

The script is pretty simple, and has a couple options. To see the help, run with the `-h` flag:

```bash
(.venv) $ python garmin.py -h
```
```
usage: garmin.py [-h] [-u] [-ua] [-p] [-d] [--dryrun] [-v] [input_file]

Tool to add Garmin device information to FIT files and upload them to Garmin Connect

positional arguments:
  input_file           the FIT file or directory to process

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -u, --upload         upload FIT file (after editing) to Garmin Connect
  -ua, --upload-all    upload all FIT files in directory (if they are not in "already processed" list)
  -p, --preinitialise  preinitialise the list of processed FIT files
  -d, --daemonise      monitor a directory and upload all newly created FIT files
  --dryrun             perform a dry run
  -v, --verbose        increase verbosity of log output
```

The default behavior will load the FIT file, and output a file named `path_to_file_modified.fit`
that has been edited, and can be manually imported to Garmin Connect:

```bash
(.venv) $ python garmin.py path_to_file.fit
```

Supplying the `-u` option will attempt to upload the edited file to Garmin Connect. Credentials
can be supplied either as environment variables named `GARMIN_USERNAME` and `GARMIN_PASSWORD`,
or by putting those values in a `.env` file in the same directory as this script (see `.env.example`).
Alternatively, if neither option is supplied, the script will prompt you interactively for a username/email
and password. The OAuth credentials will be stored in a local directory named `./.garth` (see
that library's [documentation](https://github.com/matin/garth/?tab=readme-ov-file#authentication-and-stability))
for details:

```bash
(.venv) $ python garmin.py -u path_to_file.fit
```
```

The way I personally use this script is with the `--upload-all` option, which will search
for all FIT files in the current directory, compare them to a list of files already seen (stored in
`.uploaded_files.json`) edit them, and upload each to Garmin Connect. The edited files will be written
into a temporary file and discarded when the script finishes running, and the filenames will be stored
into a JSON file in the current directory so they are skipped the next time the script is run.

On the first run of the tool (unless specifying a single file to modify) a setup process will attempt to
automatically locate your TrainingPeaks Virtual user data folder which stores the recorded FIT files. You
will also be prompted to store your Garmin credentials if they are not supplied as environment variables.
After this setup has run using the `--upload-all` option with no input file argument will automatically
process the configured TrainingPeaks Virtual user data folder.

```bash
(.venv) $ python garmin.py --upload-all -v
```

The upload all function can altnernatively be automated using the  `--daemonise` option, which will start
watching the filesystem in the specified firectory for any new FIT files, compare them to a list of files
already seen (stored in `.uploaded_files.json`), edit them, and upload each to Garmin Connect automatically.
To use the daemonise function your Garmin Credntials must either be available in your environment variables
or stored locally. When first running the tool you will be prompted to store these for the daemonise option.
To stop the daemon simply hit ctrl-c to interupt the process.

If you TrainingPeaks Virtual user data folder already contains FIT files which you have previously uploaded
to Garmin Connect using a different method then you can pre-initialise the list of uploaded files to avoid
any possibility of uploading duplicates. Use the `--preinitialise` option to process a directory (defaults to
the configured TrainingPeaks Virtual user data directory) and add all files to the list of previous uploaded
files. After this any use of the `--upload-all` or `--daemonise` options will ignore these pre-existing files.

### Already uploaded files

A note: if a file with the same timestamp already exists on the Garmin Connect account, Garmin
will reject the upload. This script will detect that, and output something like the following:

```bash
(.venv) $ python garmin.py -u path_to_file.fit -v
```
